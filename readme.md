# 010-Logo-Machine

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, and provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file. This is done through use of inquirer for handling of the question prompts and fs for handling the writing of the file.
